    <p>
        Although my paintings are based visually on the landscape in fact I am using the landscape and my own visual language as a metaphor to describe human fragility, comparing it to the ephemeral nature of the landscape.

        The Sussex landscape is the source of my current inspiration. Using acrylics and handmade pastels to build up the image, I also use marks and scribbles reminiscent of musical notes or ancient text in order to evoke deep feelings in the viewer hinting at our connection to some kind of ancient universal source ov human consciousness that lies within all of us.

        My own long term health issues have helped inform my understanding of the human condition, its joys and frailities. This has been a hard road to travel, but one of the factors that has given my work a deep sense of truth, integrity, and maturity.

        My paintings explore the relationship between us, the landscape and the ephemeral fragile nature of our
        existence. My aim is to create the feeling of space with references to not only what is physically present
        and accessible to the five senses, but what emotions, feelings and inspiration our connections with the space
        inspires in us. My work and the visual language I have created is based on the sights and sounds of what
        surrounds us in nature.

    <p> Living in the heart of the National Park on the South Downs in East Sussex in the small village of South
        Heighton allows this process to flourish and develop on a daily basis, continuously informing my work as the
        seasons and elements conspire to paint their own eternal stories across the landscape, sky and sea.
    </p></br>

    <p>My cottage, situated right on top of the Downs provides views down to the sea as well as stunning panoramic views
       of The South Downs National Park and The Ouse Valley.
    </p></br>

    <p>Daily trips onto the downs have built an intimate knowledge of, and feeling for the landscape and its flora and
       fauna. Sketches, memories and photos are then taken back to the studio to encompass into to my work.
